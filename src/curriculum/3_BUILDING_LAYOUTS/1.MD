#Fundamentals of Building Layouts in CSS

Whether you end up freelancing or working for an agency, the chances are high you’ll end up having to build a website or app someone else has already designed. Before you get to coding up a design, typically the following happens before:

1. A client comes to you or an agency to build them a website or web app.
2. Designers and management team work with the client in an exploratory phase to discover what the site needs to accomplish.
3. Once site requirements are determined, the designer goes heads down to mock up what the finished version should look like. During this time, they might interact with you the developer to figure out what is possible given a certain amount of time (i.e. the deadline)
4. After the mockups are complete, they are approved by the client and any other stakeholder in the project and are handed off to the developer.
5. Developer starts coding.

Some developers will take a quick look at the mockup, maybe have a chat with the designer to clarify any functionality, then jump right into writing code. To each their own here, but I highly recommend spending more than “a quick look” amount of time when you first get handed a mockup – no matter how simple of a design. 

It’s important to spend time reasoning about what you’ve got to build out and make a plan of attack rather than jumping in blindly. I call this process “taking inventory”, which involves breaking down a mockup into smaller, more manageable pieces, or components.

## Taking Inventory Practice

Let’s take a look at the above the fold section on Airbnb’s homepage.

**Above the fold**, as it applies to Web design, is the portion of a Web page that is visible in a browser window when the page first loads. The portion of the page that requires scrolling in order to see content is called "below the fold."
