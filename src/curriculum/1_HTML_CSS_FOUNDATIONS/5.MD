#CSS Properties Challenge

Open up a new Pen in Codepen. 

In the HTML editor, create a div element with the class name of "box". This new class should apply CSS properties to make the element have the following styles:

- 100 pixels tall x 200 pixels wide. 
- A red border that is 2 pixels thick.
- The background color of this element should be grey.
- Box-shadow styled at your discretion 
- Rounded corners 

When finished, save your pen and submit via the project link. You'll review with your mentor in your next session.
