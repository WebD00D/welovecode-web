# CSS: Bringing the Skeleton to Life


## Introduction

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets tell the browser what the given HTML in a document should look like. We’re talking positioning on the page, colors of text, etc. CSS is easy to grasp, but very difficult to master. I tend to see a lot of new developers try to move quickly through learning CSS, and I highly recommend you take your time. I’ve noticed that folks who rush tend to hit a wall down the road when they want to do more advanced layouts, and not really sure how to because their lack of a solid foundation.

##The “Cascade” in CSS

Styles in css read from the top of the file to the bottom, with the order of importance starting from the bottom. 

![CSS](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.21.33%20PM.png?alt=media&token=43e7a8e5-4c64-411d-84dd-2027d9ca8616)

If you look at the example above, we see two rule declarations for paragraph tags. The first one says make all paragraphs have the color of blue, and the second saying make all paragraphs have the color red.  What color do you think paragraphs will be if those css rules were applied? [Check your answer here](https://g.co/kgs/CECkPA).

##Importance, Specificity and Source Order

Now this doesn’t always mean that the last rule declared will “win”. There are three main factors that “winning” depends on: Importance, Specificity and Source Order. Take a few moments to read through a part of [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance#The_cascade) from Mozilla Developer Network. In it, you’ll discover what these key factors mean in detail and how you can apply them in your css styles.

##Spelling and Grammar of Stylesheets; Or CSS Syntax

A rule in CSS is generally made up of 3 parts. A selector and a nested property with a value. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style and the declaration contains one or more css properties and values separated by semicolons. Let’s take a look back at our paragraph style example:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.27.10%20PM.png?alt=media&token=f6f7a5f4-a95b-4ba0-b01c-d89e1289b7dd)

The “p” would be considered the selector. This rule is saying, “hey, if you’re a paragraph tag, obey these rules”. Make sure after you create your selector, you follow it with opening “{“, and closing “}” curly braces, as this is where you’ll put your styling rules.

Next, take a look at color: This is what we call a CSS property. We’ll dive deeper on properties here shortly, but simply put they predefined ways you can describe how a given HTML element should look or behave. All properties have predefined values as well. In this case, we have two values. One to set the color, and one to set the size of the paragraph’s text. 

Don’t forget to add a semicolon after each property and value pair!

##Types of CSS Selectors

Selectors in CSS are how you specify what elements on the page get certain styling rules applied. Say for example, all buttons should be blue – then you could target them just on the element level. What if you just want to style only one single button? Then you could give that button element an ID, and target it by the ID name. In fact, there are several ways to target elements that you should get familiar with: 

###Target by Element type

Creating rules by element type are great for baseline styles, when you know a rule should be true for an element no matter what – like the all paragraphs in our website should be blue example.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.30.44%20PM.png?alt=media&token=46550413-fe47-4235-a82f-79ffa8794f0d)


###Target by Attribute 

HTML elements can have various pieces of information attached to help describe more in detail how they should function. For example a text input element by default will accept any and all text (letters, numbers, special characters, etc.) However, if you add a “type” attribute with the value of “number”, users will only be able to type in numerical values. 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.04%20PM.png?alt=media&token=6ca9bd4a-749d-422b-8045-ba02cf1d8179)

You can style based off these attributes as well. Say we want all numerical inputs to have a green background, you could do something like:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.10%20PM.png?alt=media&token=482eb211-58f8-49b8-ad23-4fb397067954)

The formula for selecting attributes is:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.15%20PM.png?alt=media&token=4f413613-5f9a-430c-a380-e9f751440242)

###Target by Class Name 

Classes are great, and generally my preferred solution when styling standard HTML for a simple website. Let’s go back to making all paragraphs blue example. In addition to all paragraphs being blue, maybe all inputs are to be blue too. Well, instead of writing 2 separate rule sets for paragraphs and inputs like this: 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.25%20PM.png?alt=media&token=2baa9cc0-97d7-4a50-b772-edcef8be14c0)

I would create a class called “blue” that has a color property set to a value of blue. When creating a class name selector, you can name them whatever you want just remember to put a dot immediately before the name:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.34%20PM.png?alt=media&token=83ac0959-b1f1-4955-a996-0e915cad729d)

Then, in your HTML, apply the class name using the attribute that is available on ALL elements called “class” like so: 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.39%20PM.png?alt=media&token=48be7fe7-fe2c-4635-9f40-2ed4218be035)

2 birds with one stone sort of thinking. 


###Target by Element’s ID Attribute

I hardly use ID’s, and when I do it’s when I really really just need to target a very specific element on the page. Similar to class names, instead of a dot, you use a hash. Note, that elements can’t share an ID name. They must be unique. Styling by ID name should also be a last resort.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.38.22%20PM.png?alt=media&token=df9f37a3-3a58-4d97-927a-226c33a6b2e5)

##CSS Selector Practice

Here's a quick little Codepen to give you some practice. 

In the HTML tab, you've got two H1 tags. One of which has an Id of "blue-headline", and the other a class of "red-headline". In the CSS tab, you're going to need to write some CSS that targets these two elements and applies their respective color properties. You can review the output of your code by clicking the "Result" tab.

Hint: To give an element a color, you can use the color attriute like so: `color: blue;`

##Common CSS Properties

CSS styles are just rules to tell the browser how something should look. You set these rules using what’s called properties. Say for example you want a box to be 100 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide – you would use the height and width properties to do something like:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.16.08%20PM.png?alt=media&token=01193da0-7b95-46c2-b244-5b057f53846c)

There are tons and tons of various properties that do all kinds of things, however the most common ones you’ll use fall into 4 categories: positioning, display, colors, and font/text. 

##Positioning Properties

Positioning in CSS is all about the flow of elements in an HTML document. Easily enough to remember, `position` is the primary property you’ll use for controlling flow. 


**Static **- By default, the position properties value is set to “static”. When elements are positioned statically, they’ll show up in the browser in the order they appear in your HTML markup, one on top of another, starting from the top left corner of the page.

**Fixed** - When an element’s position is set to “fixed”, it will stay in place even when the user scrolls. Recall ever seeing a navigation bar at the top of a webpage float with you as you scroll? That’s fixed positioning in action. 

**Relative** - Similar to static, “relative” positioned will still keep elements in normal flow (rendered in the order they appear in the HTML).  The difference between static and relative however, is that we’re able to use offsets.

What are offsets you ask? Great question!

Offsets are 4 positioning helper properties that can only be used when an element’s position is set to fixed, relative, and absolute - not static. The properties namely are top, right, bottom, left. Say for example we have one element on a web page. As we know, by default, elements will lay out in order of appearance starting from the top left (x=0, y=0) corner of the browser. What if we want that element to sit 20 pixels from the top, and 30 pixels from the left though? We could do something like this:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.20.10%20PM.png?alt=media&token=f62f4665-dc42-4eed-bdd9-eb794e530f7a)

Which in turn, would achieve something like this:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.20.17%20PM.png?alt=media&token=54b47673-e6e8-4ed4-a37c-dc9b49313aee)

**Absolute** - Lastly, we’ve got absolute positioning. Similar to fixed, absolute elements are outside of the normal flow and can use offsets. However, unlike fixed elements, they are outside of the flow in relation to their first parent container with a non-static position. Absolute can be sort of a weird one to explain via written word, so take a look at the Codepen below. In the `.container` class, try removing the `position: relative` and you’ll see what I mean by “outside of the flow in relation to their first parent container”

<iframe height="265" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 30px" scrolling="no" title="Absolute Positioning Demo" src="//codepen.io/codewithchristian/embed/pqqVQa/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&editable=true" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

##Display Properties

The `display` property determines how the element is rendered in the browser. Possible display values we’ll cover are inline, block-level, and inline-block.

**Inline** - Inline elements like links and span, don’t start on a new line, and generally will not contain any other elements inside them as children. Inline elements don’t get width, height, margin, or padding. Instead, their dimensions are determined by how much space the content inside them require. 

**Block-level** - Block-level elements have total opposite qualities to inline. An element with `display: block` set, will be displayed on a new line and take the line up in its entirety. It’s height and width can be explicitly set. However, if you’d like to specify how much width they can take up, you can set a `width`, or `max-width` property on an element.

**Inline-block** - Combines inline and block level characteristics. Inline-block elements display inline like a span or link, except you can give them explicit width, height, margin, and padding. This can be useful when you need to create elements with a set width, but also want them to display side by side.


Word to the wise - a common beginner mistake is to apply the display setting property to all their CSS classes. Don’t. Often times, the default display setting will be all you need. Only explicitly set the display property when you have a specific reason to do so.


##Color Properties


Controlling the color of your elements will be a common task throughout your development career. Primarily, you’ll be wanting to set the background-color of an element, or the color of the text inside it. Both background-color and color take values in RGB, and Hex format. 
A HEX or hexadecimal color is expressed as a six-digit combination of numbers and letters that are defined by a mix of red, green and blue (RGB). Essentially, a HEX color code is shorthand for its RGB values with a bit of conversion gymnastics in between.

Examples:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.28.34%20PM.png?alt=media&token=4a54d9d5-57f5-41ec-9736-24e96a769434)

Also, if you ever want to use a color but want to lower it’s opacity, you can use `rgba` - This takes the normal rgb values, but adds an alpha value to the end that can range between 0 and 1. Zero being no opacity, and one being full.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.29.32%20PM.png?alt=media&token=e1aeb8fc-1589-4d67-bc83-42e0a052968a)

*Quick note - Notice above how the comments in css are formatted different than in HTML. Note the difference and remember the format below:*

**HTML Comment**

`<!- I'm an HTML comment -->`

**CSS Comment**

`/* I'm a CSS comment */`


##Font and Text Properties

Similar to the frequency in your career you’ll need to control the color settings of elements, you’ll often need to do the same with the element’s text style. The most common properties you’ll need to control are the font name, the size, the weight, and it’s alignment.

**Specifying which font to use **
`font-family: sans-serif;`

**Setting the size of the font**
`font-size: 12px;`

**Controlling the weight, or thickness of a font**
`font-weight: bold;`

**Controlling alignment**
`text-align: center;`

*text-align can have values of left, center, right, or justify*

##Property Order of Appearance


We’ve talked about cascading in CSS, and how sometimes the order in which a rule is specified matters. Remember the blue paragraph example? Well, there’s another “rule” in CSS, and although it’s not technically a rule, but rather an approach, its centered around keeping your code tidy. 

Take a look at the CSS below, and note how I'm ordering and grouping properties inside each selector:

<iframe height="265" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 30px" scrolling="no" title="CSS Selectors" src="//codepen.io/codewithchristian/embed/MZENJX/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/codewithchristian/pen/MZENJX/'>CSS Selectors</a> by Christian Bryant
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/codewithchristian'>@codewithchristian</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>


You’ll see there not grouped in any particular way. Although it all still works, it’s not ideal because as this stylesheet grows, and you’re working with more and more classes, it’s going to slow you down as you go back and make changes. So the powers that be have come up with a property order of appearance that I highly recommend you follow:

Group styles by type: 

* Positioning
* Display 
* Colors
* Text 
* Other

An example would be:

*Note the line break after each grouping*

##The Box Model

To understand the box model, you’ll need to start looking at every element on a web page as a rectangular box. Each box has content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another, like an onion.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.42.37%20PM.png?alt=media&token=a704db38-9fa4-4839-a679-694c118edb62)

**Content** - The content of the box (element), where text and images can appear.

**Padding** - Clears an area around the content. Padding is transparent. Can be set using the following:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.43.21%20PM.png?alt=media&token=42924ba8-f5c5-4342-bffe-efed99ef0d10)

Or, more simply:

**Border** - A border that goes around padding and content and is visible.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.44.33%20PM.png?alt=media&token=c1e75f7f-26a4-41e3-ac20-b1f4d7a6e3e9)


**Margin** - A margin clears an area outside the border and is visible.

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-17%20at%2012.44.40%20PM.png?alt=media&token=ca25542e-779e-4e8d-a8db-2683d857a8cb)

##Lesson Takeaways

To simply put it, CSS styles are just rules for how your HTML elements should look. Whether that’s where they are positioned on the page to what color they are.  To apply your rules to these elements, CSS provides you with selectors. Selectors can vary from an element’s type or ID, class name, or attribute. After you’ve successfully targeted your element, you can start setting the individual style settings, or properties in your rule. 

Although it may seem relatively simple and straightforward, CSS can and will get very tricky, especially once we get into more complex layouts. The best piece of advice I can give you here is to really really really practice these fundamental concepts. I was one of those folks who rushed in the beginning and had to “re-learn” CSS once I started working for agencies that had really awesome designers making really awesome / complex sites. So, just to overstate my point, **KNOW THE BASICS!** It’ll bite you in the butt later if you don’t, and just cause you unnecessary frustration.
