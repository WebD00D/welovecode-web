# CSS: Bringing the Skeleton to Life


## Introduction

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets tell the browser what the given HTML in a document should look like. We’re talking positioning on the page, colors of text, etc. CSS is easy to grasp, but very difficult to master. I tend to see a lot of new developers try to move quickly through learning CSS, and I highly recommend you take your time. I’ve noticed that folks who rush tend to hit a wall down the road when they want to do more advanced layouts, and not really sure how to because their lack of a solid foundation.

##The “Cascade” in CSS

Styles in css read from the top of the file to the bottom, with the order of importance starting from the bottom.

If you look at the example above, we see two rule declarations for paragraph tags. The first one says make all paragraphs have the color of blue, and the second saying make all paragraphs have the color red.  What color do you think paragraphs will be if those css rules were applied? [Check your answer here](https://g.co/kgs/CECkPA).

##Importance, Specificity and Source Order

Now this doesn’t always mean that the last rule declared will “win”. There are three main factors that “winning” depends on: Importance, Specificity and Source Order. Take a few moments to read through a part of [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance#The_cascade) from Mozilla Developer Network. In it, you’ll discover what these key factors mean in detail and how you can apply them in your css styles.

##Spelling and Grammar of Stylesheets; Or CSS Syntax

A rule in CSS is generally made up of 3 parts. A selector and a nested property with a value. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style and the declaration contains one or more css properties and values separated by semicolons. Let’s take a look back at our paragraph style example:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.27.10%20PM.png?alt=media&token=f6f7a5f4-a95b-4ba0-b01c-d89e1289b7dd)

The “p” would be considered the selector. This rule is saying, “hey, if you’re a paragraph tag, obey these rules”. Make sure after you create your selector, you follow it with opening “{“, and closing “}” curly braces, as this is where you’ll put your styling rules.

Next, take a look at color: This is what we call a CSS property. We’ll dive deeper on properties here shortly, but simply put they predefined ways you can describe how a given HTML element should look or behave. All properties have predefined values as well. In this case, we have two values. One to set the color, and one to set the size of the paragraph’s text. 

Don’t forget to add a semicolon after each property and value pair!

##Types of CSS Selectors

Selectors in CSS are how you specify what elements on the page get certain styling rules applied. Say for example, all buttons should be blue – then you could target them just on the element level. What if you just want to style only one single button? Then you could give that button element an ID, and target it by the ID name. In fact, there are several ways to target elements that you should get familiar with: 

###Target by Element type

Creating rules by element type are great for baseline styles, when you know a rule should be true for an element no matter what – like the all paragraphs in our website should be blue example.

###Target by Attribute 

HTML elements can have various pieces of information attached to help describe more in detail how they should function. For example a text input element by default will accept any and all text (letters, numbers, special characters, etc.) However, if you add a “type” attribute with the value of “number”, users will only be able to type in numerical values. 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.04%20PM.png?alt=media&token=6ca9bd4a-749d-422b-8045-ba02cf1d8179)

You can style based off these attributes as well. Say we want all numerical inputs to have a green background, you could do something like:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.10%20PM.png?alt=media&token=482eb211-58f8-49b8-ad23-4fb397067954)

The formula for selecting attributes is:

###Target by Class Name 

Classes are great, and generally my preferred solution when styling standard HTML for a simple website. Let’s go back to making all paragraphs blue example. In addition to all paragraphs being blue, maybe all inputs are to be blue too. Well, instead of writing 2 separate rule sets for paragraphs and inputs like this: 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.25%20PM.png?alt=media&token=2baa9cc0-97d7-4a50-b772-edcef8be14c0)

I would create a class called “blue” that has a color property set to a value of blue. When creating a class name selector, you can name them whatever you want just remember to put a dot immediately before the name:

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.34%20PM.png?alt=media&token=83ac0959-b1f1-4955-a996-0e915cad729d)

Then, in your HTML, apply the class name using the attribute that is available on ALL elements called “class” like so: 

![Ex](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_3%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%2010.32.39%20PM.png?alt=media&token=48be7fe7-fe2c-4635-9f40-2ed4218be035)

2 birds with one stone sort of thinking. 


###Target by Element’s ID Attribute

I hardly use ID’s, and when I do it’s when I really really just need to target a very specific element on the page. Similar to class names, instead of a dot, you use a hash. Note, that elements can’t share an ID name. They must be unique. Styling by ID name should also be a last resort.

##CSS Selector Practice

Here's a quick little Codepen to give you some practice. 

In the HTML tab, you've got two H1 tags. One of which has an Id of "blue-headline", and the other a class of "red-headline". In the CSS tab, you're going to need to write some CSS that targets these two elements and applies their respective color properties. You can review the output of your code by clicking the "Result" tab.

Hint: To give an element a color, you can use the color attriute like so: `color: blue;`
