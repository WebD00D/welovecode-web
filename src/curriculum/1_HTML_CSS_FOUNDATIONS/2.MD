# Semantic HTML Challenge


## Instructions

In this challenge, you’re going to take a very poorly structured article and make it semantically up to par. 

Visit this pen I’ve created, and **fork your own copy**. 

Begin by reading through the HTML markup, and seeing what you think could be better formatted or described to the browser.  Once you think you’re finished, save it and send me the Codepen link via the project submission page.
