# HTML: The Skeleton of the Web


## Introduction

This section will teach you the fundamental concepts of HTML that we use today in modern frontend web development. At the end of the lesson, you’ll also have the vocabulary to discuss HTML with others. 

Some parts are left out or touched on briefly because, well, some components of HTML that are taught in schools and coding bootcamps you’ll literally never use, and I don’t want to waste either of our time. 

This section should go relatively quick, as it’s mostly going to be like a vocabulary lesson. We’ll have some code examples here and there, but most of your hands-on learning will come in the next section when we start applying these concepts to actual projects.

Shall we begin?

## HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language

Hypertext Markup Language. Say it out loud for me: 

>*H Y P E R T E X T - M A R K U P - L A N G U A G E.*

Good, and that’s probably the last time you’ll ever refer to HTML by its formal name. (Stick with HTML or markup)

Every single webpage you’ve ever looked at is HTML. Think of it as the skeleton of the internet. What it does is simply defines and describes the structure of a given page you’re browsing. How it does this describing per say, is using what we call elements. Elements consist of a start tag and an end tag with content in between.

`<p> We Love Code! </p>`

Really, that’s all an HTML document is – just a handful of elements. At the very least, a proper HTML file looks like the following:

###Let’s break down each section of a standard HTML file:


`
<!DOCTYPE html>
`

The doctype statement is the very first line of an HTML file. It serves one specific purpose of telling the web browser, what kind of file it’s looking at. In this case, we see the doctype is HTML. 

---


`
<html>
`

The html element we call the root, or parent element. Anything inside it are considered children. So in this case, the html element is the first element on the page and is the  parent of all elements in between it. 

---


`
<head></head>
`

The head element of of an HTML document is where you put any non-visible settings or configurations. For example, say there is a nice font you found from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) that you want your web page to use. Well, google will give you a “link” and they’ll tell you to paste that in the head of your document – that’s done here, between the opening and closing tags.

Google Font Link Example:

![Google Fonts](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/we-love-code.appspot.com/o/Unit_1_Lesson_1%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%209.42.50%20PM.png?alt=media&token=23429012-ea4a-4de4-84d5-11b8eae1d5a8)

---

```<meta charset="utf-8">```

```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">```

The meta element is very versatile. They can all represent different information about the document. The ones above for example are telling the browser what type of character encoding to use (“utf-8”), and how to control the page’s dimensions (“width=”device-width”). Most of the time you’ll never have to touch or worry about those two settings, however, common meta usage is generally when you’re wanting to add tags for sharing on Facebook, Twitter, etc. (i.e what image to use when a link is pasted somewhere).

---

`
<title>We Love Code</title>
`

The Title element contains the text that is displayed in the browser’s tab. Look at this document for example, it probably says something like “Introduction to Modern HTML..”

---

`
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
`

Remember the Google Font example from above? Note the use of the “Link” element. This creates a connection or link between the current HTML document and another resource. Most commonly used for linking stylesheets (code that contains how the web page looks).

---

`<body>`

The body tag is used to delineate the main displayable elements of a web page.

---

`
<script src="script.js"></script>
`

The script element is used to add JavaScript to the webpage. It can connect both external (lives outside of your code folder) and internal (lives inside your code folder) JavaScript files. You’ll see that in the HTML skeleton example from above, that the script tag sits inside the body tag. Note, that it can also be placed inside the head tag.

##Common HTML Elements and Why You’d Use Them

### Input fields

`<input />`

The input element, also referred to as a text box, is simply that – a field in which you can enter text. By default, the input element will accept any and all text. However, if you add an attribute named “type” to it, you can specify specifically what it can accept. For example, a number only field would look like this:

`
<input type="number" />
`

Other common input types are:

`<input type="password" />`

The password type will mask the text field with dots as you type. Common on login and signup forms.

`<input type="checkbox" /> `

Used for letting the user make a true / false selection. Commonly used when selecting from a non-required options list

`<input type="radio" />`

Used for letting the user make a true / false selection. The difference between when to use a radio versus a checkbox, is when you want to require the user to make a selection.

`<input type="file" />`

Used for allowing a user to upload a file. When selected, it will open your browser's file dialog prompt 


### Textarea field

`
<textarea></textarea> 
`

Textarea’s are essentially the same as a text input, except they are typically used for allowing users to write more than a few words of text. By default, textarea’s are a bit taller than your standard input field.

### Button

`<button>Click me</button>`

Another commonly used element is the Button, which can be used for a user to initiate some sort of action, whether that’s to login, submit a payment, or make a selection.


###Hyperlink

`<a href="https://www.google.com">Take me to google, please.</a>`

Hyperlinks, more often referred to as just a “link”, are used to direct the user to some other location than the page they are currently on. It has one required attribute, “href”, where you specify the location you want it to direct the user, once clicked on. 

###Image

`<img src="https://bit.ly/2Fg7Xhw" alt="stock photo of the ocean" />`

The internet would be pretty boring without images, so thank god for this element. The only required attribute is the “src” (source), in which you specify the URL where the image is located. However, it’s best practice to provide an “alt” tag to briefly describe what the image is of. This is meant to help screen readers for people with disabilities, or poor internet connection (where an image might not load).


###Div

`<div></div>`

Divs serve the primary purpose of grouping HTML elements inside of a section. They are considered “block level” elements. Block level elements start on their own line and stretch out as far as they can to the left and right. Divs are the primary element you’ll use when structuring and building layouts for your web pages, because you can nest other elements inside them:

`<div><input type="text" /></div>`


###Span

`<span>Hello</span>`

Unlike the Div, spans are considered “inline” elements, and do not disrupt the flow of the document. For example you could wrap a line of text inside a paragraph without the paragraph breaking to a new line:

`<p>My favorite color is <span class="blue-text">blue</span></p>`


###H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6

`<h1>I’m a headline</h1>`

The H tags, ranging from h1 - h6, is used for headlines and titles. Typically though you’ll probably only really need to use H1-h3. By default, the only difference between them is font size. The largest being H1, and the smallest being h6. 


###Other Tags to Consider

When you get a chance, you can take a look at [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) document which outlines in detail the most common HTML tags and what their purpose is. Don’t worry you don’t need to memorize these right now, it will just happen naturally as we start building projects together. However, I do suggest bookmarking that link as a resource.

##Commenting Code

Often times developers will need to make a note of something in their code. Whether that’s to explain what they are doing for other developers to see later, or a reminder for themselves. Whatever the reason, code that is “commented out”, will not be rendered by the browser. 
To make a comment, simply wrap whatever text you want to use as a comment in an opening `<!--` and closing `-->`. Example:

```<h1>Sample Section Title</h1>```

```<!-- TODO: Ask what the font size should be for headlines -->```

##Semantic HTML

Overall, HTML is relatively straightforward to learn, and there are really only two concepts you’ll need to remember: Semantic HTML, and Non-Semantic HTML. As a general rule you’ll want to make sure your markup is always semantic. Semantic HTML gives the page meaning by using the proper elements when structuring your content. Using Semantic HTML is also easier to work with because it becomes much more clearer as to what each piece of content is on a document.

###What the difference looks like:

Non Semantic:

`<b>I'm bold text</b>`

An example of a non-semantic HTML element would be the bold tag, which just increases the font weight of the selected text. This is more of a styling treatment, and not really telling the browser what the text is.

Semantic:

`<address> 10 S. Crenshaw Ave. Richmond, VA 23230 </address>`

Immediately you had a pretty good idea of what type of content was going to be in between those tags right? So does the browser. 

One thing to note, these are not just made up tags. All HTML tags are predefined and standardized. So you can’t do something like:

`<car>Toyota Tacoma</car>`

because the car tag doesn't exist...

In addition to the list of tags linked above, you can also check out [this](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) resource for a full list of semantic HTML elements. Also, to learn more about why semantics are important, I highly recommend checking out [this](http://boagworld.com/dev/semantic-code-what-why-how/) short article by Paul Boag.

##Lesson Takeaways
Although we didn’t cover every single inch of the HTML landscape, we did go over the main points that makeup the language. Also, it’s okay if you don’t memorize all of the elements – You’ll have plenty more practice with them as we continue through the course.

However, if there is just ☝️ one thing I’d want you to remember: The difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML.  Once you’ve taken a few minutes to review the list of semantic elements from the section above, and read the article by Paul Boag., head on over to the next session and take the “Semantic HTML Challenge”. You'll review it with your mentor in our next session.
